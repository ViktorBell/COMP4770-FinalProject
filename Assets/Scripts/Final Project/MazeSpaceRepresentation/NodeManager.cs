/* Nodemanager maintains a list of all nodes and their states (explored, unexplored, etc.), as well as team-specific information like exploration progress.
 * For the idea of a 'Living Maze Behavior' the NodeManager can be used to control maze dynamics, such as moving walls, generating tar pits, or even creating new paths. 
 * Since the NodeManager will have information about all the nodes, it can make intelligent decisions about how to modify the maze based on the agents' positions, progress, or other factors.
